    Loads the Irssi module, requiring at least version 20011211 and telling
    it to export signal_add() and command() into our package.
    This kind of version checking came available in the 20011208-snapshot.
    Having te Irssi:: subs exported came available in the 20011211-snapshot.
    
    >> sub sig_own
    
    Warns the user: chatting while having windows switch all the time is
    foolish, because your text gets sent to whatever window has the focus
    when you press enter.
    
    >> signal_add
    
    This was exported into our package, so we can use signal_add() without the
    "Irssi::" prefix. Since the 20011207 snapshot, you can add multiple signals
    using a single add_signal(). If you want to do so, use a hash reference
    (either { foo => bar, foo2 => bar2 } or \%hash).
    
    >> sub { ... }
    >> \&subname
    
    These are references to subs(code). The first one is a reference to an
    anonymous sub, the second one refers to a named one. Anonymous code
    references allow for easy placement of oneliners :)
    Irssi understands codereferences since the 20011207 snapshot.
    Using references is better than having a string with the function name,
    imho.
